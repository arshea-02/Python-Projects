## 1. Arithmetic Arranger
The code takes a string of an arithmetic addition or subtraction problem, calculates  the answer and then formats it in the following manner:
                      3801
                    +   47
                    ------
                      3848    
                      
The numbers are right aligned and a space of 4 characters exists between 2 problems

## 2. Time Calulator
The code consists of a function that takes a start time and duration in hour-minute form (12:04 PM). It is for calculating time for a 12-hour clock while also calculating the correct meridiem(AM or PM), the day of the week and how many days later would the new time be. According to the instructions of the project, no Python built in liberaries has been used. The project incorporates complex calculations and use of if-elif staments in order to achieve the desired result.
